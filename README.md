# MazeSearchGame

This is a 'game' in which you can create your own maze, for which the game then searches for a solution.
The maze is created with the dimensions specified at the top, after which you can set a start and end point using the buttons below.
Upon searching, you must create a new maze, otherwise the buttons to search will be disabled.

** Left click/drag to create walls.
** Right click/drag to erase walls.

Have fun!
